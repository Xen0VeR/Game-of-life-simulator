# Game of Life Visualization

This project is a visualization of Conway's Game of Life using Python's `pygame` library. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton that simulates the evolution of cells on a grid based on a set of simple rules.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You'll also need the `pygame` and `numpy` libraries. To install them, use the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame numpy
```

```bash
python game_of_life.py
```

Left Mouse Click:

Click on any cell to toggle it to an "alive" state (green).

You can add as many alive cells as you want before starting the simulation.

Press the Enter Key: TO Start.

Starts or pauses the simulation. The cells will evolve according to the rules of Conway's Game of Life when the simulation is running.
Close the Window:

You can exit the program by clicking the close button on the window or pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal.
